title: BrainStation Capstone Project Published!
---

Just published my Capstone project from BrainStation's Data Science bootcamp, with a wordy title of Picking the Best Predictive Model: A Case Study in Analytics Operationalization.  The genesis of the project came from my experiences in industry where there is both a tendency to go for the complex (and expensive) solution first, and a healthy skepticism for Machine Learning from the business folk as well.  In my opinion, how you actually choose which models to progress into development and deployment needs to be based on the combination of technical scoring criteria and the relative cost-benefit and projected impact of the model on the business KPIs and associated decision-making processes once deployed.  

I found a case study to explore this space in the world of Equipment Reliability. Starting with the simplest solution (do nothing) as a baseline, I built a series of progressively more complex statistical and machine learning predictive models that would prevent unplanned equipment failures while maximizing the equipmentâ€™s useful life.  I then rationalized each model's performance in qualitative terms from both the technical aspects and the business impact KPIs in order to understand if the model would be viable for deployment in the chosen business scenario.  Short summary: Both statistical models and ML models are found to be viable for the case study with different levels of impact on the business KPIs relative to the operationalization costs and benefits.
