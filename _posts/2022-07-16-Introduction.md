**July 2022**

It’s official, after three months of intense effort and long hours, my cohort and I have graduated from BrainStation’s Data Science bootcamp. What a great experience it was, learning the full range of tools and skills that need to be in the hands of today’s data scientists: from SQL to Python and R, from Statistics to Machine Learning to Deep Learning, from the Command Line Interface to the Big Data platforms with Hadoop, Hive and PySpark. Along the way, we learned through hands-on project work how to communicate our results to different audiences and create impactful visualizations and presentations. I highly recommend this program to anyone looking to build a solid foundation for a career in Data Science or to upgrade your skills for further success in your field.

Now onto the next challenge:  Finding the next data science projects to try out my new skills :)
